                    <p>Deadpool is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by
                        Fabian
                        Nicieza and Rob Liefeld, the character first appeared in New Mutants #98 (December 1990). In his
                        comic book
                        appearances, Deadpool is initially depicted as a supervillain of the New Mutants and X-Force,
                        though later
                        stories would portray him as an antihero. Deadpool is the alter ego of Wade Wilson, a disfigured
                        Canadian
                        mercenary with superhuman regenerative healing abilities. He is known for his tendency to joke
                        incessantly
                        and break the fourth wall for humorous effect.</p>

                        The character's popularity has seen him featured in numerous forms of other media. In the 2004
                        series Cable & Deadpool, he refers to his own scarred appearance as "Ryan Renolds [sic] crossed
                        with a Shar-Pei".Reynolds himself would eventually portray the character in the X-Men
                        film series, appearing in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), Deadpool (2016), and its sequel
                        Deadpool 2 (2018). Reynolds attributes Cable & Deadpool #2 to what got him invested in
                        the character and inspired him to bring the character to the movies.He will continue
                        playing the character in Deadpool 3 (2024), set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
